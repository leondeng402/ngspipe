README for ngspipe
---------------------

--------
Files:
--------
1. ngspipe.py: the main program 
2. config.py: configuration file for database files, variables and other info
3. region.py: contains all the functions for region level annotations
4. gene.py: contains all gene level annotation methods
5. variant.py: contains all variant level annotation functions


-------------
Dependency:
-------------
1. python3.4 is installed
2. perl is installed and needed by annovar
3. Annovar is installed and should be on the system $PATH 
4. All database files is downloaded to annovar default folder


--------
Usage:
--------
1. To get help: 
	python3.4 ngspipe.py -h
2. To annotate either vcf files or standard annovar input files:
	python3.4 ngspipe.py -i input.txt -o outdir
3. To time each operations:
	python3.4 ngspipe.py -i input.txt -o outdir -t
4. To delete all the temporary files:
	python3.4 ngspipe.py -i input.txt -o outdir -d
5. To expand refgene gene entries:
	python3.4 ngspipe.py -i input.txt -o outdir -e
6. To filter variants:
	python3.4 ngspipe.py -i input.txt -o outdir -f filter_file	
7. To rank variants:
	python3.4 ngspipe.py -i input.txt -o outdir -r rank_file
8. To save results in the formats of subject, proband, trios, family, 
	all in one file or all formats
	python3.4 ngspipe.py -i input.txt -o outdir \
	--mode ['mono', 'singleton', 'proband', 'trios', 'family']
	-m pedigree_file
	
-------
Test:
-------
1. Check input files' all columns: chr, start, end, ref, alt
	range of values in those fields
2. Use variants with unknown genetype and geneinfo to check gene annotations
	negative
3. Use postive files to check all levels of annotations

---------------
Known Issues:
---------------
1. table_annovar use 1000G2012Apr as default and it leads to the popfreq_max is 
not consistent with 1000G2014Sep data we use
2. expand gene entries operation: only expand (VariantFunction, Gene, 
GeneDetail, ExonicFunction, AAChange) from refGene. The fields from knownGene
and ensGene are kept as they are. However, if -e is used with -m, all entries
in (VariantFunction, Gene, GeneDetail, ExonicFunction, AAChange) are expanded
